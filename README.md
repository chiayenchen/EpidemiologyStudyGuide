DISCLAIMER:  
There are typos and potentially some conceptual errors in this study guide. If you find any please let us know. We wrote it to help us study for the 2011 Epi written exam and is not intended to supplement or replace any of the coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health. It has not been reviewed or endorsed by any HSPH faculty member. _**Use at your own risk!**

The process of making this guide helped us synthesize the concepts in the core courses of the Epidemiology department at HSPH. It draws very heavily from the notes in those classes, including the draft of Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robins' causal inference book. Where possible we also looked at key methods papers. We hope to supplement the guide with a general list of references in the near future. We do not claim original thought and we would underscore that the notes are not endorsed by any of the faculty, instructors, or authors of said courses and papers. The study guide is not intended to infringe on the intellectual property or copyright of any other individuals or parties. Please contact us in case of any questions or concerns.
